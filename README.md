How to use this Python script
----------------------------

There are two variables in the script that need to be changed to specified values to make it work.

**X** = The number of lines you want to generate

**Y** = The maximum number of digits that should be in each generated number

You can also change the name of the file it generates, but if you don't, you'll get an output file named FILENAME_HERE.txt
